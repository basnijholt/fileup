# Configuration

fileup uses a configuration file at `~/.config/fileup/config.ini` to manage your upload settings.

## Configuration File

Before you can start sharing your files, you'll need to create a configuration file at `~/.config/fileup/config.ini` with the following structure:

```ini
# ~/.config/fileup/config.ini
[default]
protocol = ftp  # or scp
hostname = example.com  # or the Host from your ~/.ssh/config
base_folder = /path/to/files  # where files are stored on the server
file_up_folder =  # subdirectory in URL, can be empty
url = files.example.com  # the actual URL where files are accessible

[ftp]
username = my_user_name
password = my_difficult_password

[scp]
# If empty, will use your SSH config
username =
# If using SSH config, no need for these
private_key =
password =

```

For FTP uploads, you need to provide both `username` and `password` in the `[ftp]` section.

### SCP Configuration

<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
For SCP uploads, you have two options:
1. Use your SSH config by setting `protocol = scp` and using a hostname from your `~/.ssh/config`
2. Explicitly configure SCP by providing `username` and optionally `private_key` in the `[scp]` section
