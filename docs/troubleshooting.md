# Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions when using fileup.

## Common Issues

If you see an error about the configuration file not being found, make sure you have created the config file at `~/.config/fileup/config.ini`.

See the [Configuration](configuration.md) page for the required format.

### FTP Connection Failed

1. Verify your hostname is correct
2. Check that your username and password are correct
3. Ensure the FTP server is accessible from your network
4. Try connecting with a standard FTP client to verify credentials

### SCP Connection Failed

1. Verify the hostname matches an entry in your `~/.ssh/config`
2. Ensure your SSH key is properly configured
3. Test the connection manually with `ssh hostname`
4. Check that the destination folder exists on the server

### Permission Denied

1. Verify you have write access to the destination folder
