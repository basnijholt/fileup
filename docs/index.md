`fileup` is your go-to Python package for hassle-free uploading and sharing of files right from your command-line interface.
You can set a time limit after which the file will be automatically removed, ensuring the security of your data.

> [!TIP]
> Just call `fu myfile.txt` to upload it and get the URL in your clipboard!

I frequently need to share files quickly with colleagues or friends. Whether it's a screenshot, a code snippet, or a Jupyter notebook, I wanted a tool that:

1. Works from the command line with minimal typing
2. Automatically copies the URL to my clipboard
3. Supports automatic expiration for temporary files
4. Requires no external dependencies

`fileup` was born out of this need - a simple, focused tool that does one thing well.
