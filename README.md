## :package: Installation

To install `fileup`, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install -U fileup
```

## :memo: Configuration

Before you can start sharing your files, you'll need to create a configuration file at `~/.config/fileup/config` with the following structure:

```less
# ~/.config/fileup/config.ini
[default]
protocol = ftp  # or scp
hostname = example.com  # or the Host from your ~/.ssh/config
base_folder = /domains/example.com/public_html/
file_up_folder = stuff

[ftp]
username = my_user_name
password = my_difficult_password

[scp]
# If empty, will use your SSH config
username =
# If using SSH config, no need for these
private_key =
password =
```

## :video_game: Usage

For a list of available commands, type `fu -h`.

In a nutshell, you can use `fileup` by running:

```bash
fu filename
```

If you're uploading a Jupyter notebook (`*.ipynb`), the returned URL will be accessible via [nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org).

Check the output of `fu -h` for more information on how to set a time limit for your file:

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- fu -h -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- CODE:END -->
<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ‚ö†Ô∏è This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
```bash
usage: fu [-h] [-t TIME] [-d] [-i] filename

Publish a file.

Create a config file at ~/.config/fileup/config with the following information and structure:

example.com
base_folder
file_up_folder
my_user_name
my_difficult_password

positional arguments:
  filename

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TIME, --time TIME  If time is 0 the file will never be deleted, default is 90 days.
  -d, --direct
  -i, --img
```

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

## :green_apple: macOS Integration

`fileup` currently supports the `pbcopy` command, so the URL will be automatically copied to your clipboard on macOS systems. üìã‚ú®

## :warning: Limitations

Please note that the automatic clipboard copying feature is only available for macOS users at the moment.
